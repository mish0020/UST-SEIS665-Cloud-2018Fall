RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install..... && \
    apt-get .....      \
like that. One run command is needed. Each RUN command generate a layer - reduced efficiencies. so, try this way !!
it's called chaining RUN command
    
    
    
    ENTRYPOINT["python"]
    CMD ["site.py"]
    
    etc....


now the question : why and how to get around the 79 char length ....?

linting should have taken care of it :

 nnn nnn nn \
       next line
 
post :
sh "[ \"\$(docker ps -q -f name=classweb1)\" ] && docker kill classweb1 && docker rm classweb1"

docker stop classweb1 || true ------------> IS A BAD IDEA !!! never do this !!! pipeline may be failing, but this always return TRUE !!

dive utility analyze docker image..... dive <container name>
a diagnostic tool...
